    <h1>History of the Internet</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <div>The internet was created during the Cold War which took place in the 1950’s and 60’s. Both nations took it upon themselves to improve their science and weapon capabilities in fear of the other attacking. At the time, computers were larger than today’s models, mainframes took up too much room space and the were only capable of limited tasks. Researchers needed computers for these tasks, however, they frequently had to travel long distances in order to find a computer to do that specific task.</div>
        <div>With packet-switching, a fraction of the data could be sent individually then later combined into a single packet. This allowed computers to connect to each other over a network called ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). ARPANET set the foundation to the modern internet. In 1969, ARPANET had a successful experiment with a 4-node network setup and in 1983 they introduced the TCP/IP protocol site which set a foundational framework for internet communication and data exchange.</div>
        <div>In the year 1990, the internet was commercialized and in the same year, a man named Tim Burnet created the World Wide Web.</div>
        <div>In 1994, came the first browser called Netscape Navigator and this started the browser wars due to rapid advancements in browser technology.</div>
        <div>Towards the end of the 90's, the rapid expansion of online services increased due to the emerging of the dot-com bubble.</div>
        <div>All the mentioned events shaped the internet as we know it today.</div>
