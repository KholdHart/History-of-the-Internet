      <header><div>Web application architecture refers to the structure and organization of a web-based software application. It outlines how various application modules and components work together to give users functionality. In the creation of online applications, a variety of architectural patterns and models are employed. The three-tier architecture, which consists of the display layer, application logic layer, and data storage layer, is one often used model. </div></header>

            <h3>Presentation Layer (Front-End): </h3>

            <p>This layer is responsible for the user interface and user experience. It's the part of the application that users interact with directly. The presentation layer includes components like web pages, user interfaces, forms, and any visual elements users interact with. Created with technologies such as HTML, CSS. </p>

        <li>

            <h3>Application Logic Layer (Back-End): </h3>

            <p>choices and communicates with the data storage layer. The business logic, validation, security, and any other procedures necessary for the application to function are all included in this layer. The back end of online applications is frequently created using programming languages like Python, Java, Ruby, Node.js, and frameworks like Django, Ruby on Rails, Flask, Express.js, and Spring Boot.</p>

            <h3>Data Storage Layer (Database): </h3>

            <p>Data management and archiving for the application are handled by the data storage layer. Incorporated into this are structured data types including user profiles, product details, transaction logs, and others. Databases are used to effectively manage, organise, store, and retrieve this data. Both relational and NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB and Redis, are frequently used in web applications. </p>
