    <h1>Overview Of The World Wide Web</h1>
    
    <div>The <b><u><i>World Wide Web</i></u></b>, otherwise known as <i>WWW</i> or<i> W3,</i> is a term that describes a system of interconnected documents and pages that are accessed with web browsers through the internet. 
         The World Wide Web revolutionized communication, information sharing making it more accessible and efficient and this is done by allowing users to navigate using hyperlinks.</div>
    <div>The web was created by British computer scientist Sir Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 who had the big intention of connecting everyone</div>
    <div>The web's basis lies in its innovative concept of <i>hypertext</i>, where text contains links (known as hyperlinks), directing users to other relevant documents.</div>
 
    <h3>Some web browsers that allow users to use the W3 include</h3>
    <ul class="browsers">
        <li>Google Chrome</li>
        <li>Firefox</li>
